<h2>Investigating the Iris dataset (Instructions)</h2>

<p>For this task, <span id="condition_instruction_iris"></span> After this, you will be asked a set of questions measuring your understanding of the visualization.
  <strong>Remember, you cannot go back or reload for the duration of this study.</strong></p>
  <h4>Please read carefully:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You will <strong>not</strong> have the visualization for reference when you answer these questions.</li>
    <li>You will have three minutes <span id="condition_instruction_iris_B"></span>. Please study the visualization carefully.</li>
    <li>Once you move on to the multiple choice questions, <strong>you will not be able to go back or reload.</strong></li>
    <li>If you do not remember the answer, <strong>please do not guess. </strong>Every question has an "I do not recall" option.</li>
    <!-- <li>Keep in mind, that the weather patterns in this park may or may not match what you expect.</li> -->
