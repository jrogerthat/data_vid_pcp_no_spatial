00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.160
This parallel coordinates plot presents a&nbsp;
multivariate analysis of the classic Iris dataset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.000
displaying four distinct axes corresponding&nbsp;
to the features: sepal length, sepal width,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.520
petal length, and petal width. Each axis&nbsp;
represents a different dimension of the data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440
scaled to accommodate the range&nbsp;
of values for that given feature.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.880
This plot allows us to discern the relative&nbsp;
differences and similarities among the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.480
Iris species across all four measured features.&nbsp;
The plot is color-coded with blue, magenta,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.320
and orange lines, each representing one of the&nbsp;
Iris species. The blue lines denote Iris setosa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.840
the magenta lines represent Iris virginica, and&nbsp;
the orange lines correspond to Iris versicolor.
